# Reinforcement Learning Agent for Automatic Car Driving

## Description
This project focuses on developing an agent using deep reinforcement learning algorithms to drive a car in the Better Car Racing environmentâ€”a customized version of the CaRacing environment from OpenAI's Gym library.

## Installation
Follow these steps to install the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/trinhminh11/BetterCarRacingRL.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd BetterCarRacingRL
    ```
3. Install the required libraries from `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Inference
To perform inference, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python infer.py --model={algorithm} --net_type={type_of_network} --seed={random_seed} 
```

- **`{algorithm}`**: The algorithm to use. Choose from `dqn`, `a2c`, or `ppo`.
- **`{type_of_network}`**: The type of neural network used. Options are `linear`, `cnn`, or `combine`.
- **`{random_seed}`**: Random seed. In demo, we use `720402`.



### Checkpoints
Our checkpoints are stored in https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/13I0mJML9XxceiFH6wCoKmndTez8bsLZG

Create this below folder to save checkpoint:

```bash
checkpoints/BetterCarRacing-v0/
```

Checkpoints of each agent will be saved in 

```bash
checkpoints/BetterCarRacing-v0/{algorithm}
```
